# Exercise 02: Design of a calculator

In this new project, you need to display an AppBar at the top of your screen with the
title “Calculator”.

You also need 2 Text fields (one for display the expression and one for display result) and
several buttons. For the moment just display “0” inside the 2 Text fields, you will deal with it in the next exercise.

Buttons :
- Numbers from 0 to 9.
- “ . ” the decimal numbers.
- “AC” will reinitialize the expression and result.
- “C” will delete the last character of the expression.
- “=” will display the result of the expression.
- Operators : “ + ”, “ - ”, “ * ”, “ / ”.

You must add an debug. For each button you press, you can display the text of the
button in the debug console.

Once all the button have been properly set, make sure the display is suitable for all de-
vices (phone, tablet, other devices).

# Exercise 03: It’s alive!

Now you have to make your calculator work!
So you have to add the logic to it.

( ndr: *For this, the exercise 03 was directly merged into the 02. That's why you only see "Ex02"* )

The Text fields you have created in the previous exercise must display the expression and
the result of the expression.
- You must be able to do the following operations :
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- you can perform several operations in one expression (ex : 1 + 2 * 3 - 5 / 2).
- Must be able to enter a negative number (by pressing the “ - ” button before the
number).
- Must be able to enter a decimal number.
- Must be able to delete the last character of the expression.
- Must be able to delete the whole expression and result.

You can have something like this :

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful, if you don’t test properly your code, you can have some problems. For example, if you enter an incorrect expression, a division by 0, a very big number etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Your apllication must NEVER crash!
